# Statistical Digital Signal Processing and Modeling

Direct impelementation of statistical digital signal processing algorithms from the book by the same name by Professor Monson H. Hayes.

The book represents algorithms as:

1. set of instructions (pseudo-code) annotated in Tables.
1. matlab code annotated in Figures.
1. described in words in the body of the text.

## Chapters

4. Signal Modeling
5. The Levinson Recursion
6. Lattice Filters
7. Optimum Filters
8. Spectrum Estimation
9. Adaptive Filters
